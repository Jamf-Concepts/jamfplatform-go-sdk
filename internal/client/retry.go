// isRetryableWriteStatus reports whether a response with the given status,
// from a request using method, is safe to retry automatically.
//
// 429 and 503 are gateway-level rejections — the request never reached
// Jamf's application logic, so retrying is safe regardless of method. 501
// ("Not Implemented") is permanent and never retried. Any other 5xx (500,
// 502, 504, or a malformed/zero status) may mean the application partially
// processed the request before failing, so retrying is restricted to
// methods that are idempotent by definition (GET/DELETE/PUT/HEAD) — retrying
// a POST or PATCH risks double-applying a write the server actually
// completed before the client saw the failure (e.g. creating a duplicate
// object).
//
// PUT's idempotency assumption has one important carve-out: it only holds
// when the server has no side-channel precondition that advances as a side
// effect of a successful write. A handful of Jamf Pro V3 endpoints (computer
// and mobile-device prestage enrollment — see jamfplatform/pro's
// version_lock_helpers.go and its two callers, the only VersionLock users in
// the whole SDK) require an optimistic-lock field in the PUT body, sourced
// from a GET taken before the write. Confirmed live: such a PUT can commit
// successfully server-side (bumping the lock) and still return a 500 if the
// response serializer then crashes; blindly retrying it replays the
// now-stale lock and gets a genuine 409 OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_FAILED instead of the
// original 500 — turning a successful write into a reported failure.
//
// Given that's a small, enumerable set today rather than an inherent
// property of PUT in general, the default here stays retry-on for PUT, and
// the known exceptions opt OUT individually via DoWithContentTypeNoRetry
// (see its doc). Any future endpoint that gains a similar precondition
// (VersionLock, ETag, If-Match, or equivalent) must route through that
// no-retry entrypoint too — this function has no way to know from a bare
// method+status that a given PUT carries one.
//
// All other statuses (2xx, and 4xx other than 429) are left alone: a
// byte-identical retry won't change a client-request problem, and this
// function is never consulted for them in the first place since
// DefaultRetryPolicy already excludes them upstream of this check.

// Deliberately does NOT extend this to endpoint-specific 4xx semantics
// (e.g. a classic API's misleading "400" on an accepted-async delete, or a
// transient "409 problem matching limitation user group" during a
// from-scratch apply). The transport has no way to tell a permanent 4xx

// jamfBackoff is retryablehttp.DefaultBackoff with one addition: the wait is
// always clamped to maxWait.
//
// DefaultBackoff supplies everything else — exponential backoff of
// minWait*2^attemptNum capped at maxWait, overflow-guarded, plus Retry-After
// parsing (seconds and date form) for 429 and 503. The clamp is needed
// because that Retry-After path returns the server's value verbatim and
// uncapped, which would let a misconfigured or hostile header stall a
// request far past what maxWait promises callers. For the exponential path
// the clamp is a no-op, since DefaultBackoff already caps there.
//
// This deliberately does NOT use retryablehttp.RateLimitLinearJitterBackoff,
// which the SDK previously selected — presumably for its Retry-After
// handling, which DefaultBackoff also has. That function samples uniformly
// over the *entire* [minWait, maxWait] window and multiplies by attempt
// number, so under this SDK's 1s/60s window the very first retry waited ~30s
// on average and a four-retry sequence averaged over three minutes — all of
// it inside a single httpClient.Do emitting no log output (see
// logRetryAttempt), which is indistinguishable from a hang. DefaultBackoff
// bounds the same sequence at 1+2+4+8 = 15s.
//
// One property is given up in the swap: DefaultBackoff is deterministic, so
// concurrent requests that fail together wake together and collide again.
// That is tolerable while no Jamf path rate-limits (as of 2026-08-31 every
// prod Tyk plan carries rate: -1 and the gateway reports
// x-ratelimit-limit: 0 with no Retry-After on any response). If rate
// limiting arrives without a Retry-After header, revisit this and add
// jittering around the exponential band — not by returning to the linear
// variant. See docs/WIRE-FACTS.md#rate-limiting.

// logRetryAttempt is the RequestLogHook: retryablehttp calls it immediately
// before every attempt, with attemptNum 0 for the first.
//
// It exists because the retry loop is otherwise invisible from outside the
// transport. execute() logs one request, hands the whole loop to a single
// httpClient.Do, and handleResponse logs only the response that survives it
// — so a caller watching the log sees exactly one request and one response
// no matter how many attempts ran or how long the backoff waited. A
// four-retry sequence and a single slow call produce identical output, which
// is what made a multi-minute retry sequence read as a hang.
//
// Attempt 0 is skipped because execute() has already logged it; without that
// guard every request would log twice. The body is deliberately nil rather
// than a replay of the original: the bytes are identical across attempts, so
// re-dumping them multiplies a large request body through the log for no
// diagnostic gain.
//
// The retryablehttp.Logger argument is always nil here — newRetryClient sets
// rc.Logger = nil, and retryablehttp's hook dispatch passes nil through its
// default branch rather than skipping the hook. The SDK's own Logger is read
// from the Transport at call time, so a logger installed after construction
// (SetLogger, WithLogger) is picked up.

// logRetriedResponse is the ResponseLogHook: retryablehttp calls it after
// every attempt that produced a response, before it decides whether to wait
// and try again.
//
// It is the other half of logRetryAttempt. Logging the retried *requests*
// alone leaves the log reading "request, request, 404" — the status that
// actually caused each retry never appears, because handleResponse only ever
// sees the response that survives the loop. That cost is documented in this
// SDK: requirePackageStore's doc in jamfplatform/acc_helpers_test.go records
// four package tests failing on a 404 whose real cause was a 500 two hops
// earlier, which took a wire probe to establish. With this hook the 500 is in
// the log next to the 404 that replaced it.
//
// Gating is the whole design problem: the hook fires for every attempt's
// response, including the last one, and handleResponse already logs that one.
// Logging unconditionally would double-log every single request in the SDK.
// So the same predicate that drives the retry decides whether to log —
// jamfCheckRetry (and through it isRetryableWriteStatus), consulted with a nil
// error exactly as retryablehttp consults it — which means the statuses logged
// here can never drift from the statuses actually retried. err is nil rather
// than resp's own error because retryablehttp does not call this hook at all
// when the attempt failed at the transport layer (resp would be nil), so a
// response reaching here always came back from the server.
//
// One duplicate survives that gate deliberately: when retries are exhausted,
// the final attempt is retryable by policy but not retried, because
// retryablehttp checks the remaining budget after this hook and passes no
// attempt number here to reconstruct it. That response is logged twice — once
// as retryable, once by handleResponse as the surviving response. One extra
// line at the end of an exhausted sequence is a better trade than either
// tracking per-request attempt state in a Transport shared by concurrent
// callers, or dropping the last (and most interesting) failure from the log.
//
// Headers and body are both nil, which is the same discipline as
// logRetryAttempt's nil body. The body especially must not be read here:
// retryablehttp drains it to reuse the connection when it retries, and on the
// not-retried path it is the body handleResponse decodes for the caller —
// consuming it would break decoding. A nil http.Header is safe for a consumer
// logger, since Get and range are both nil-safe. The status is the only thing
// a retry sequence adds: the method and URL are already on the LogRequest line
// this response answers, and the Logger interface's LogResponse carries no
// place for them anyway.
//
// As in logRetryAttempt, the retryablehttp.Logger argument is always nil
// (newRetryClient sets rc.Logger = nil, and retryablehttp's hook dispatch
// passes nil through its default branch), and the SDK's own Logger is read
// from the Transport at call time so a logger installed later via SetLogger or
// WithLogger is picked up. Installed next to logRetryAttempt in NewTransport
// rather than in newRetryClient, for the same reason: it is a method on the
// Transport, which does not exist when newRetryClient runs.

// newRetryClient builds a retryablehttp.Client around authed — the

// retry attempt re-enters authed, so token refresh and request pacing both
// apply per attempt, not just to the first one.
//
// ErrorHandler is set to PassthroughErrorHandler, which is load-bearing and
// not a style choice: retryablehttp's default behavior on retry exhaustion
// is to drain and discard the final response body and return a synthetic
// "giving up after N attempts" error instead. That would break every caller
// that inspects the concrete *APIResponseError (helpers.IsNotFoundError,
// IsServerError, AsAPIError, .TraceID, .Errors, …) once retries run out on a
// persistent failure. PassthroughErrorHandler returns the underlying
// (resp, err) pair untouched — for a plain non-2xx response with no
// transport-level error, err is nil, so this call site's caller sees a
// final response exactly as if it had never been retried, and the existing
// handleResponse decoding path is unaffected.
