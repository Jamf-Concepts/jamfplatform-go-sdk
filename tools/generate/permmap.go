// The published permissions map at
// https://developer.jamf.com/platform-api/reference/jamf-pro-permissions-map.md
// is a third privilege oracle, and the only independent one.
//
// The specs' own `x-required-privileges` is where the SDK's registries and
// godoc come from. The GitOps bundle's `_permissions/routes.yaml` cannot
// corroborate that, because it is *generated from* those same extensions — its
// agreement is tautological. The published map is hand-authored from the
// gateway's capability model, so agreement between it and the specs is
// evidence, and a disagreement is a defect in one of them.
//
// This file parses a committed snapshot of it. `TestScopedPrivilegesUseGAVocabulary`
// is the enforcement point: it reads the generated registries and checks every
// identifier against what is parsed here.
//
// # Why a parsed snapshot rather than a transcribed table
//
// That test previously asserted against `gaCapabilityActions`, a hand-typed
// transcription of the same article. It caught real defects, but a
// transcription drifts silently from its source and every ingest that meets a
// new capability has to extend it by hand. Parsing the article removes both:
// `make permmap` re-fetches it, and the check is against what Jamf publishes
// rather than against what somebody last copied out of it.
//
// The snapshot is committed because the check must run in CI, which has no
// network and no access to the private specs.
//
// # What is checked, and what deliberately is not
//
// Checked: every `{capability}:{action}` the generated registries carry must be
// declared by the map — the capability present, and the action in its declared
// set — plus the identifier form itself, since a return to the retired
// three-part beta slug (`create:pro:buildings`) would silently change the
// meaning of every consumer's permissions table. None of that needs path
// semantics, so it is exact.
//
// **Not** checked: whether the map's capability for a *path* matches the spec's.
// The map's Endpoints column lists resource-root prefixes with version segments
// collapsed and longest-prefix-wins, which sounds mechanical, but the cells
// abbreviate continuation roots — `disk-encryption-recovery-key` reads
// "Pro `/computers-inventory/filevault`, `/{id}/filevault`", where the second
// entry means `/computers-inventory/{id}/filevault` and its prefix has to be
// inferred from the preceding entry in the same product chunk. Inferring it
// wrongly would silently attribute a path to the broader capability, either
// manufacturing a disagreement that is the parser's fault or hiding a real one.
// A checker that is quietly wrong is worse than no checker, so the path
// dimension is left to the reader.
//
// Nor is the map ever a *source* of privileges. Its actions are a set per
// capability rather than per operation, so deriving them would be less precise
// than the specs already are, and it would get the conjunctions wrong:
// `POST /mobiledevicecommands/command` needs `destructive-device-actions:{x}`
// **and** `devices:{c}`, while `DELETE /logflush` takes `flush-policy-logs:{x}`
// **or** `policies:{d}` — the alternatives-versus-conjunction trap in
// docs/STYLE.md#required-privileges.

// permissionsMapFile is the committed snapshot, relative to the generator's own
// directory (`make permmap` writes it there from the repo root).
const permissionsMapFile = "permissions-map.md"

// minDeclaredCapabilities guards against a snapshot that parsed to nothing — a
// redirect, a login page, or an upstream restructure that moved the tables. A
// parser that silently finds nothing reports perfect agreement, which is the
// one failure mode this check must not have. The published map declared 125
// capabilities on 2026-09-03; anything under this is a broken snapshot rather
// than a shrinking API.

// permissionsMapException records a `{capability}:{action}` the generated

// an entry for a permission the SDK no longer emits, both fail. Neither is a
// problem to work around — each means the exception has served its purpose.
